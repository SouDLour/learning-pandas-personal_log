# Personal FCC-Data_Analysis-Log

### This is <u>not</u> a portfolio

Working with python PANDA's via Free Code Camp. While I made applications and other programs, I decided to pivot more into data analytics. So far, the main usgae of PANDAS, that ive noticed are:

-   Cleaning Data & Duplicates

- reading(CSV,Excel FILES,db,text,HTML) / Opening them and cleaning for further analysis.

-  Conditionals. Specific ways to get specific data. Eg: data_base.loc['Sales'] > 200 etc....
  
  - Can be useful for exmaing certain sales within  a certian time frame, as well as amount spent with x customers at z time of year. Highly powerful with many possibilites!!
  
  Most importantly turning those data samples into solutions or possible outcomes.

***This repository is just some small follow-along and some experimenting. Also includes some NUMPY. May also include random ipynb. Think of it as a personal learning dump folder***

# Why is numpy faster:

1. Numpy uses less bytes of memory

2. No Type checking when iterating through objects

3.  Numpy uses Contiguous Memory
   
   1. Memory store's block near each other.
   
   2. SIMD: SIngle instruciton multiple Data vector processing
      
      1. Performs computations on all values in row at one time.
   
   3. Cache is used on computer 

# Applications of Numpy:

Plotting (matplotlib)

backend(Pandas, connect 4)
